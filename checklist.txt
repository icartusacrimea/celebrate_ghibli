*1.* first page users will see will be a miyazaki bio...his achievements, influence,
 song, and info on studio ghibli as well (keep in mind users might be first timers) 
 -slow theme intro(nothing too much) on homepage load, give users option to stop songs
    -initial background wallpaper custom animation? 
        example codepen: 
        http://codepen.io/MAW/pen/KdmwMb
        - diff/smaller leaves? and less leaves? maybe not leaves at all, something else
        - falling animation against what background?

*2.* give users the ability to sift through all the movies (20 in all from my count) 
 -change the background wallpaper according to the movie chosen
 -present information about it, including
 -soundtrack (playing with the idea of either YouTube API or Soundcloud API), play 
 the first song off a playlist, it will be the theme song etc for that movie
    -if soundcloud api, make own playlist for each movie
 -plot summary (will be hidden initially and user can uncollapse if he/she wants)
 -panel of pictures/snapshots of the films (clone of Netflix UI)
    -initially try without library
    (but if we need library, React Motion for animation?)

*3.* user authentication
        -pick favorite movies
        -post on forum/message board (post for each movie like soundcloud for songs?)
        -pick which soundtrack/songs they like
        -share all their picks
        -profile pic?
        -recommendations for other movies like studio ghibli/miyazaki 
            (don't have to be animated)

*4.* "Choose your 3 most favorite films!" poll, possibly including which regions 
like which movie etc
        -allow users to create more polls? (such as favorite char, favorite scene, etc)
        -Data visualization(haven't decided if this is necessary): D3(too complicated?) or Chart.js
            -most beloved studio ghibli films
            -most beloved songs/soundtracks
            -any polls created by users

*5.* chatroom or forum-like setting?
    -maybe forum-like posting is better than real-time chat? discuss with icartusacrimea
        -decide view layout of posts, how will users see/interact with posts?
